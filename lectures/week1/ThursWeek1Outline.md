    - https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/53/1058 - "Welcome to the Projects & Algorithms portion of your program! Having completed projects to unveil to the public is a vital first step toward displaying your skill sets.  Take the time today to think about and mention 1. What website(s) you wish you could have help build/maintain. 2. What website(s) you might take ideas from to build your own projects and why, 3. Pick a CSS framework you want to explore this month."
    - https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/53/1059 - "We're going to be hot and heavy into algorithm work alongside our projects.  We focus mostly on Arrays and Singly Linked Lists.
