- Don't forget discussion topics!  Here are this week's:
    - https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/53/1058 - "Welcome to the Projects & Algorithms portion of your program! Having completed projects to unveil to the public is a vital first step toward displaying your skill sets.  Take the time today to think about and mention 1. What website(s) you wish you could have help build/maintain. 2. What website(s) you might take ideas from to build your own projects and why, 3. Pick a CSS framework you want to explore this month."
    - https://login.codingdojo.com/d/97/53/1059 - "We're going to be hot and heavy into algorithm work alongside our projects.  We focus mostly on Arrays and Singly Linked Lists.  Explain the difference between a data TYPE and a data STRUCTURE in your own words, and list at least two other data structures besides Singly Linked Lists."
    - Due Sunday night at 10:59 PM Pacific!  If you encounter technical issues, send me screenshots of the problem AND your responses, both by the deadline!
- Fill out group project form!  Due Tuesday!  An email will be sent after today's lecture!
