/* Min to Front

Given an array of comparable values, move the lowest element to array’s front, 
shifting backward any elements previously ahead of it. Do not otherwise change 
the array’s order. Given [4,2,1,3,5], change it to [1,4,2,3,5] and return it. 
As always, do this without using built-in functions.
*/



/* Concat

Given an array of comparable values, move the lowest element to array’s front, 
shifting backward any elements previously ahead of it. Do not otherwise change 
the array’s order. Given [4,2,1,3,5], change it to [1,4,2,3,5] and return it.
As always, do this without using built-in functions.

/* Parens valid

Create a function that, given an input string str, returns a boolean whether parentheses in str are
valid. Valid sets of parentheses always open before they close, for example. For "Y(3(p)p(3)r)s",
return true. Given "N(0(p)3", return false: not every parenthesis is closed. Given "N(0)t )0(k",
return false, because the underlined ")" is premature: there is nothing open for it to close.
*/



/* String: Is Palindrome

Create a function that returns a boolean whether the string is a strict palindrome. For "a x a" or
"racecar", return true. Do not ignore spaces, punctuation and capitalization: if given "Dud" or
"oho!", return false.
